Abstract:
One of the fastest growing areas of condensed matter physics explores "twistronics." By stacking sheets of two-dimensional materials, and then twisting the sheets relative to each other, large-scale moire patterns emerge in the overall lattice. Most research in the field has focused on the properties of twisted graphene bilayers. We explored the electronic properties of a less studied category, the twisted "Janus" transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) bilayers. TMDs are a category of 2D material with a layer of transition metal atoms between two layers of chalcogen atoms. They are called "Janus" when the chalcogens on each side of the sheet are different. We developed a computational framework to explore the behavior of these materials over a variety of twist angles and stacking configurations. Using this computational model, we examined the parameters that produce a host of valuable phenomena, including superconductivity and unique charge density distributions. The resulting properties were displayed for a large number of materials and published in a collaborative materials science database.
